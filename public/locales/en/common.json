  "content": "The sea has always been part of Mallorca's identity—not only for travel and trade, but also as inspiration for its cuisine. On our boat tours, you won’t just enjoy crystal-clear waters and hidden coves — you'll also taste the island's soul.\n\n- We serve traditional snacks like pa amb oli: rustic bread with local tomato, olive oil, and cured ham or cheese.\n- You'll also taste sobrasada, Mallorca’s iconic cured sausage, along with trencades olives and roasted almonds.\n- For dessert, we offer the classic ensaïmada, a sweet pastry that’s pure Balearic tradition.\n- Everything is paired with local drinks: island wines, craft beer, and fresh water.\n\nEating on board has deep roots in Mallorcan maritime history. Sailors and fishermen brought simple, lasting foods for their voyages. Today, we honor that custom in our tours — updated for modern palates but true to its heritage.\n\nBoat trips in Mallorca become a cultural immersion: each flavor tells a story. Join us and discover the Mediterranean with every bite.\n\nReady for a flavorful journey at sea?"

    "title": "Did you know the Balearic coastline hides unique geological and natural wonders?",
    "body": "With over 1,400 km of coastline, the Balearic Islands are full of contrasts, stories, and stunning corners. From white-sand beaches to rugged cliffs, the Balearic coast is not only visually striking but also fascinating from geological, ecological, and cultural perspectives. In this article, we’ll uncover some of the curious facts that make it so special, focusing on one of its hidden gems: Alcudia Bay, with its incredibly clear waters."
  },
  "section2": {
    "title": "A coastline shaped over millions of years",
    "body": "The coastal landscape of the Balearics has been formed over millions of years by tectonic movements, erosion, wind, waves, and rainfall. This natural sculpting has created caves, coves, and dramatic cliffs.\n\nThe predominant limestone composition supports the formation of underground caves and channels, and also filters rainwater—contributing to the remarkable clarity of the surrounding sea. It’s no coincidence that some of the clearest waters in the Mediterranean are found right here."
  },
  "section3": {
    "title": "Alcudia Bay: A northeast Mallorcan treasure",
    "body": "Among all the Balearic coast’s natural wonders, Alcudia Bay stands out with its serene beauty and unspoiled nature. Its transparent waters, spaciousness, and well-preserved surroundings make it a paradise for locals and visitors alike.",
    "sub1": {
      "subtitle": "Turquoise waters thanks to sandy seabeds",
      "body": "Alcudia Bay owes its turquoise hue and clarity to its fine, white sand seabed, with minimal underwater vegetation in shallow zones. Sunlight reflects and refracts easily here, creating a dazzling optical effect. The absence of nearby rivers also prevents sediment from clouding the water."
    },
    "sub2": {
      "subtitle": "Gentle currents that keep the waters clean",
      "body": "Unlike more enclosed coastal areas, Alcudia Bay opens to the northeast, allowing soft marine currents to circulate and renew the water continuously. These almost invisible microcurrents help maintain a naturally clean environment, making swimming here feel like dipping into a natural pool."
    },
    "sub3": {
      "subtitle": "Protected and undeveloped natural surroundings",
      "body": "Large areas near the bay—especially around Albufera and Son Serra de Marina—are either protected or minimally developed. This reduces human pressure and pollution (both visual and acoustic). Responsible boating practices and increased tourist awareness also play a key role in preserving this unique setting."
    }
  },
  "section4": {
    "title": "Sustainable ways to enjoy the coastline",
    "body": "The best way to experience Alcudia Bay is from the sea. Boat tours, paddle boarding, kayaking, and snorkeling allow you to reach secluded spots without harming the environment. Here are some eco-friendly tips:\n\n- Choose local, environmentally conscious tour providers.\n- Leave no waste and don’t disturb marine life.\n- Avoid non-biodegradable sunscreen.\n- Respect protected areas and navigation zones.\n\nThese small actions make a big difference in preserving this coastal treasure for generations to come."
  },
  "section5": {
    "title": "A destination that blends science, nature, and beauty",
    "body": "The Balearic coastline is much more than picturesque beaches—it’s a complex natural system shaped over time, rich in biodiversity and geological interest. Alcudia Bay perfectly represents the balance between preservation and enjoyment. Walking along its shores, swimming in its waters, or simply observing the landscape from a boat can be a transformative experience. It's more than a tourist destination—it’s a living ecosystem we must cherish, learn from, and protect. Its crystal-clear waters are no coincidence; they are the result of conscious conservation and respectful human interaction.\nCome discover it and let the magic of its waters captivate you!"

It’s ideal for people seeking calm and unspoiled views. Shallow, transparent waters make it perfect for swimming, snorkeling or simply relaxing while staring at the horizon.

  "section4": {
    "title": "How to get there and what to know",
    "body": "Alcanada is just a 5-minute drive from Alcudia or the Port, and you can also walk there along a scenic coastal path. Parking is limited, so it’s best to arrive early in high season. There are no beach services like showers or bars, so bring water, food, proper footwear and sun protection. Although it’s not a sandy beach, its natural beauty more than makes up for it."
  },
  "section5": {
    "title": "Alcanada: where nature speaks for itself",
    "body": "Visiting Alcanada is a different kind of experience.

Perfect for couples, peaceful walks or sunset swims, Alcanada is a place that stays in your memory.\nCome and discover this quiet paradise in northern Mallorca and let yourself be enchanted by its natural charm!"

  "section1": {
    "title": "The sea isn’t always the same: why weather matters",
    "body": "When we book a boat trip in Mallorca, we often imagine blue skies and calm seas—but the sea changes constantly. Wind, air pressure, currents and other weather elements directly impact your onboard experience. Understanding these factors not only increases safety but helps you choose the right tour and timing for your day at sea."
  },
  "section2": {
    "title": "Wind: the key player in the Mediterranean",
    "body": "In Mallorca, wind is the main factor that shapes sea conditions. The most common types are:\n- **Embat**: a light sea breeze blowing inland in the afternoon. Refreshing and pleasant in summer.\n- **Tramuntana**: a northern wind, dry and strong, causing waves especially in the north and west.\n- **Levante**: comes from the east, often brings humidity and choppy seas to the southeast and northeast.\n- **Mistral**: gusty and forceful, less comfortable for sailing.\nKnowing these helps you predict whether the sea will be calm, choppy, or if a trip might be canceled."

    },
    "sub2": {
      "subtitle": "Moderate or changing wind",
      "body": "Stronger wind brings more waves and movement. On such days, it’s best to choose larger boats or routes in protected areas like bays. It’s a fun option for those looking for a bit of adventure on board."
    },
    "sub3": {
      "subtitle": "Adverse conditions: when to stay ashore",
      "body": "With storm warnings, tramuntana gusts or sudden pressure changes, it’s best to reschedule. Not just for safety—it’s about comfort too: choppy waves, splashes or motion sickness can ruin the experience. Reliable operators in Mallorca won’t go out in poor conditions."
    }
  },
  "section4": {
    "title": "Tips to choose the best day to sail",
    "body": "Always check the forecast and ask your local operator if unsure. Look for days with light wind (under 10 knots), stable high pressure and no alerts. Mornings tend to be calmer, and areas like Alcudia Bay or the south coast are more sheltered. Apps like Windy or Spain’s AEMET give detailed info on wind and wave forecasts."

  "section5": {
    "title": "Weather: your ally for a great boat trip",
    "body": "Rather than a problem, knowing how to read the weather can make your boat day even better. Choosing the right time boosts safety and enhances your connection with the sea. You'll learn to watch the horizon, listen to the swell and appreciate every moment.\nThe Mediterranean is ever-changing—but always magical.
