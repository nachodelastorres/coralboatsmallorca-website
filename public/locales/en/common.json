We know when the northern wind brings the perfect sailing day and when it’s better to stay ashore enjoying a coffee at the port.\n\nAfter countless conversations with travellers who stepped on board full of questions —when is the best time to visit? where do locals really eat? which coves don’t appear in guidebooks?— we realised it was time to gather all that knowledge in one accessible place.\n\nThat’s how this blog was born: not as a marketing tool, but as a natural extension of what we do every day. We want anyone arriving in Mallorca looking for something authentic to find honest answers, practical advice and, above all, inspiration to experience the Mediterranean in a different way."

We are a family project, born from a deep passion for the sea and for this island we call home.\n\nOur boat is a traditional Mallorcan llaüt —a wooden vessel that has sailed these waters for decades. It can accommodate up to 35 people on our regular tours and up to 50 on private charters. It’s not the fastest boat, but it has something modern boats can’t replicate: soul.\n\nWe sail from the Port of Alcudia, on the north coast of Mallorca. It’s a privileged area: the bay is sheltered from prevailing winds, the waters are calm and crystal-clear, and there are hidden coves only accessible by boat.\n\nThe atmosphere on board Coral Boats is relaxed but lively —what we like to call Mediterranean good vibes. Background music, conversations with the skipper and crew sharing local stories, laughter, toasts with homemade sangria and the contagious energy of people enjoying the sea. We’re not a silent cruise, and we’re not a wild party boat either. We are that perfect balance where you can relax in the sun, meet new people, dance a little if you feel like it and genuinely have a great time."

A good conversation with the skipper, a toast with homemade sangria while watching the horizon, music, laughter and swims in crystal-clear coves —these are the moments that stay with you.\n\nWe don’t want you to step on board and feel bored. We want you to relax, laugh, meet interesting people, taste local flavours and step off the boat thinking: “That was amazing.”\n\nThis blog reflects that philosophy. No constant sales pitches, just real stories, useful knowledge and a genuine love for this corner of the Mediterranean."

      "body": "There are destinations you visit… and destinations that pull you in. Alcudia belongs to the second group. Located on the north coast of Mallorca, this small town combines something that’s hard to find on the island: an old town with over 600 years of history enclosed by medieval walls, kilometre-long white-sand beaches, a charming fishing port, and a sheltered bay that is probably the best place in Mallorca to enjoy calm sea conditions.\n\nBut Alcudia isn’t just a pretty postcard. It’s the perfect base to explore the entire north coast: from the wild cliffs of the [Serra de Tramuntana](https://coralboats.com/es/blog-details/costa-norte-mallorca-acantilados-calas-secretas) to the family-friendly sands of Playa de Muro, passing through hidden coves you can only discover by boat. It’s a place where families looking for tranquillity, couples on a romantic escape, groups of friends craving adventure, and solo travellers wanting to truly switch off all coexist.\n\nThis guide comes from years of living here and knowing every corner of the area. It’s not a generic “top 10 things to see” list. It’s what’s genuinely worth it, with practical tips so you can make the most of every day. Let’s go."

Unlike other tourist villages, the walls here aren’t decoration: they’re real, you can walk on them, and they enclose a maze of cobbled streets where time seems to stand still.\n\nAlcudia’s walls date back to the 14th century and are the best preserved in Mallorca. You can stroll along the top and enjoy the contrast between the medieval interior and the mountains surrounding the town. The best time to do it is at sunset, when golden light warms the stone and temperatures drop — just like we explain in our guide about [watching the sunset from the sea in Alcudia](https://coralboats.com/es/blog-details/puesta-de-sol-alcudia-mar-inolvidable).\n\nInside the walls, the streets are filled with small craft shops, terrace cafés and restaurants where you can try Mallorcan cuisine without the bustle of the most touristy areas. Don’t miss the Church of Sant Jaume, the Town Hall with its clock tower, and the small Plaça de la Constitució, perfect for a coffee.\n\nBut if there’s one special day to visit the old town, it’s Tuesday or Sunday. Those days you’ll find the **Alcudia market**, one of the most authentic on the island. It’s not a tourist-only market: here you’ll find fruit and vegetables from Mallorcan farms, local cured meats, artisan cheeses, sobrasada, freshly baked ensaïmadas, and seasonal products that change throughout the year. Arrive early (before 10am) to avoid crowds and enjoy it at an easy pace."

But if what you want is something authentic and peaceful, classic wooden boats offer a completely different experience.

The [marine life in the bay](https://coralboats.com/es/blog-details/vida-marina-bahia-alcudia-especies-mediterraneo) is surprisingly rich: posidonia seagrass meadows, schools of seabream, octopus, starfish, and with luck even a turtle.

Combine it with a visit to S'Albufera (they’ll love seeing animals) and a calm boat trip where they can swim and snorkel. Avoid speedboats and choose stable boats. We have a [complete guide to plans with kids in Mallorca](https://coralboats.com/es/blog-details/planes-barco-familias-ninos-mallorca).\n\n**If you’re coming as a couple looking for romance:** Sunset from the walls, dinner in the old town, and a sunset boat trip are musts. Consider a [private tour](https://coralboats.com/es/blog-details/excursion-barco-privada-o-compartida) if you want total intimacy.\n\n**If you’re travelling with friends and want fun:** Port d’Alcudia has bars and nightlife. During the day, water sports, beach time and a catamaran with music can be your best bet.\n\n**If you’re a solo traveller or want to disconnect:** Alcanada early in the morning, walking routes through S'Albufera, and a classic boat with few passengers. Seek calm and you’ll find it.\n\n**If you’re staying only a few days and want to see a lot:** Prioritise old town + beach one day, a boat trip the next, and a day trip to [the prettiest villages in Mallorca](https://coralboats.com/es/blog-details/pueblos-mas-bonitos-mallorca-2025) on the third.

See our [guide on how to get around Mallorca](https://coralboats.com/es/blog-details/como-moverse-por-mallorca-transporte-alquiler-coche).\n\n**When to go:** High season (July–August) has the best weather but also more people and higher prices. June and September are ideal: great weather, warm sea and less crowding. May and October are perfect if you prioritise tranquillity over water temperature.\n\n**About accommodation:** Port d’Alcudia has more atmosphere and is close to the beach. The old town is quieter and more charming. Playa de Muro is the go-to option for families wanting an all-inclusive resort. More details in our guide on [where to stay in Mallorca](https://coralboats.com/es/blog-details/donde-alojarse-mallorca).\n\n**What to bring:** Sunscreen (the sun hits hard), comfortable shoes for the old town, a swimsuit at all times, and some cash for markets. If you plan to snorkel, your own gear is always better than rental."

Ask any local.\n\n**The most beautiful sunsets** aren’t from the beach, but from the walls — or better yet, from a boat in the middle of the bay watching the sun drop behind the Tramuntana.\n\n**The market has two sides:** Sundays are more touristy and bigger; Tuesdays are more local and authentic. Both are worth it, but they’re different experiences.\n\n**To escape the crowds**, always go early. At 8am the beach is empty, boat coves at first light are magical, and the old town at that hour smells like fresh coffee and bread from the oven.\n\n**Wind can change your day:** The Bay of Alcudia is sheltered from the north, but when the Levante blows the sea gets choppy.

But you don’t understand Alcudia in a rush.\n\nThis is a place to wake up slowly, have breakfast on a terrace facing the sea, cycle to Alcanada, spend the afternoon floating in a hidden cove, have fresh fish for dinner at the port, and walk the walls as the sun goes down. It’s a destination best enjoyed at a different pace.\n\nIf you’re looking for a place in Mallorca that combines history, nature, spectacular beaches and that feeling of being somewhere authentic (but with everything you need for a comfortable holiday), Alcudia is probably your best choice.\n\nAnd if you want to add an experience you’ll always remember, set aside a day to go sailing. The bay from the water, swimming in coves that don’t appear on maps, and the sense of freedom you get out in the middle of the Mediterranean… no resort can give you that.\n\nSee you at sea. See you in Alcudia."

      "body": "There is something you only truly understand once you have sailed around Mallorca: the island changes completely when you see it from the water. Cliffs that look distant from land reveal their wild character when you approach them by boat. Coves that appear as tiny dots on Google Maps turn into sheltered havens with impossibly clear water. And that Mediterranean blue, already stunning from the beach, reveals shades ranging from turquoise to emerald depending on depth and time of day.\n\nBut then comes the question every traveller eventually asks: which type of boat excursion should I choose? Because sailing along the [north coast of Mallorca](https://coralboats.com/es/blog-details/costa-norte-mallorca-acantilados-calas-secretas) on a speedboat is not the same as doing it on a wooden boat with history. A catamaran with music and a lively atmosphere is very different from an intimate vessel where the only sound is the water brushing against the hull.\n\nThis guide is the result of years navigating these waters and hundreds of conversations with travellers who, after their excursion, told us what they expected and what they actually experienced. Some made the perfect choice. Others, very honestly, admitted they would have chosen differently if they had known then what they know now. To make sure you are in the first group, here is everything you need to know before booking."

      "body": "Before comparing boats, there is a more important question: what are you really looking for in a day at sea? It sounds obvious, but most disappointments come from not thinking this through. Let’s be direct.\n\nIf you are travelling with small children, safety and comfort are your priorities. A speedboat may sound exciting to you, but for a four-year-old who needs space to move, eat on time and maybe take a nap, it can quickly become stressful. On the other hand, there are [family-friendly boat excursions](https://coralboats.com/es/blog-details/planes-barco-familias-ninos-mallorca) designed with a different rhythm, where children can enjoy the experience without pressure.\n\nIf what you want is to truly disconnect, think about what that means to you. Does disconnecting mean lying in the sun with a drink in hand and music in the background? Then a catamaran might be perfect. Or does it mean silence, contemplation and feeling far away from everything? Then you need something more intimate.\n\nIf snorkelling and exploring marine life are high on your list, make sure the excursion actually allows enough time for it. Some tours stop so briefly that you barely have time to put your mask on. The best [snorkelling spots near Alcudia](https://coralboats.com/es/blog-details/snorkel-mallorca-mejores-lugares-alcudia) require calm and time to be truly enjoyed.\n\nAnd if you are celebrating something special — a birthday, a farewell, an anniversary — the key question is whether you want to do it privately or don’t mind sharing the moment with strangers.

Perfect for groups of friends looking for adrenaline.\n\n**What you should know:** Space is limited, so comfort is not their strong point. Engine noise makes conversation difficult during navigation.

They often include drinks or open bar options, and some offer activities such as paddle boarding or snorkelling. Perfect if you are travelling with a large group or want to meet new people.\n\n**What you should know:** Privacy is almost non-existent. You may share the boat with 30, 50 or even more people. The atmosphere is usually festive, with music you cannot control. Stops are often at popular coves shared with other catamarans.

The pace is slow, groups are small (usually fewer than 12 people), and the experience is designed to savour every moment. These are the boats chosen by travellers who have already tried other options and are looking for something different.\n\n**Best part:** Real intimacy, personalised attention from the skipper, and routes that avoid overcrowded coves. They often include local gastronomy (not just generic catering) and generous time for swimming and snorkelling. The silence when the engine stops and you hear only the sea is something you never forget.\n\n**What you should know:** They are slower, so routes cover less distance. They do not have the amenities of a modern catamaran (no jacuzzi here). And because they are intimate, you need to book earlier as places sell out quickly.\n\n**Ideal for:** Couples, families seeking calm, photographers, travellers who value authenticity over quantity, intimate celebrations, anyone who truly wants to disconnect."

      "title": "The 7 most common booking mistakes (and how to avoid them)",
      "body": "After years in this industry, we see the same patterns again and again. These are the mistakes that most often ruin experiences that could have been memorable.\n\n**1. Choosing only by price.** The cheapest tour is rarely the best value. It often means more people on board, less time at each stop, poorer food (or none), and a generic experience. A €50 excursion where you spend the day cramped can end up costing more than an €80 one that includes everything.\n\n**2. Not checking sea conditions.** The Mediterranean is usually gentle, but on some days the tramontana or easterly winds completely change conditions. A speedboat excursion with waves can be very uncomfortable. Always check the forecast — we have a [guide to weather and sailing in Mallorca](https://coralboats.com/es/blog-details/viento-meteorologia-barco-mallorca) that can help.\n\n**3. Underestimating duration.** A 2-hour excursion is a quick ride. If you want to snorkel, eat on board and truly relax, look for tours of at least 3–4 hours.\n\n**4. Not asking how many people will be on board.** A catamaran for 20 people is very different from one with 60. A classic boat with 6 passengers feels intimate; with 15, it starts to feel crowded. Always ask about capacity.\n\n**5. Forgetting the essentials.** Sunscreen, hat, towel, extra swimwear… the number of people who arrive without the basics is surprising. Check our [what to bring on a boat tour checklist](https://coralboats.com/es/blog-details/que-llevar-a-un-tour-en-barco-mallorca) before heading out.\n\n**6. Booking the wrong day.** If your only free day is Sunday, half the island will be at sea. Tuesdays and Wednesdays are usually much quieter.\n\n**7. Not considering the time of day.** Mornings offer better light and calmer seas. Afternoons give you the chance to see the [sunset from the water](https://coralboats.com/es/blog-details/puesta-de-sol-alcudia-mar-inolvidable). Think about what you prefer."

(drinks, food, snorkelling equipment, towels...)\n- How much time is spent at each cove?\n- Does the skipper know the area well? Do they speak my language?\n- What happens if the weather is bad? Is it cancelled, rescheduled, or refunded?\n- Can we bring our own food or drinks?\n- Is there shade on board?\n- Is it accessible for people with reduced mobility?\n\nA serious company will answer without hesitation.

After trying every option and listening to hundreds of travellers, we truly believe the classic boat offers something the others cannot replicate: a genuine connection with the sea and with the essence of Mallorca.\n\nIt’s not for everyone. If you want a party, loud music and socialising, a catamaran will make you happier. If you want speed and to see as much as possible in a short time, a speedboat will do the job. But if what you want is to slow time down, feel that you are living something authentic, and return home with the sensation of having truly disconnected… then a boat with history is your place.\n\nAt Coral Boats, we sail a traditional Mallorcan llüt in small groups, along routes that avoid overcrowded coves. We include local gastronomy, real time for swimming and snorkelling, and a close, personal approach because we believe that is how the Mediterranean should be experienced. It is not the cheapest option nor the fastest, but it is the one you will remember.\n\nIf this resonates with you, we invite you to discover our [boat excursions from Alcudia](https://coralboats.com/es/boat-tours-alcudia). And if you still have doubts, write to us. We would rather help you choose well — even if it’s with another company — than sell you something that is not right for you.\n\nThe sea of Mallorca deserves to be enjoyed.

      "body": "Let’s get to the point: **private** and **shared** are not “two versions of the same ride.” They’re two different ways of living the sea.\n\nA **private boat tour** means the boat is only for your group. That usually translates into:\n\n- Freedom to choose the **time slot** (subject to availability).\n- The option to adjust the **route and itinerary** to your preferences and sea conditions.\n- A flexible pace: spend longer where you want, swim without rushing, take photos at your rhythm.\n- A level of intimacy that’s very hard to replicate.\n\nThat’s why many travellers choose it for celebrations, romantic escapes, groups that want comfort, or families who want to control timing. If that sounds like you, here’s the direct link to explore it calmly: [Private charter in Alcudia](https://www.coralboatsmallorca.com/en/alcudia-private-boat-charter).\n\nA **shared tour**, on the other hand, is an excursion with seats for different travellers. And here’s the key: when it’s well designed, it’s not just “the cheaper option”—it’s the **social** option.\n\n- You pay per person and it’s usually more accessible.\n- The vibe is more dynamic (and sometimes really fun).\n- If you travel solo or as a couple, it’s a great way to enjoy a full experience without paying for an entire boat.\n- The itinerary is structured so everyone gets a great day.\n\nIn practice, lots of travellers who want a smart budget choice—or simply a beautiful experience with zero hassle—go for this option. You can see them all here: [Boat trips from Alcudia](https://www.coralboatsmallorca.com/en/boat-tours-alcudia).\n\nAnd then there are “hybrid” formats in terms of feelings: a morning tour often feels more like “exploration + swimming,” while a sunset tour tends to feel more “romantic + contemplative.” If you want to compare them right now:\n\n- [Morning boat tour in Alcudia](https://www.coralboatsmallorca.com/en/alcudia-morning-boat-tour)\n- [Sunset boat tour in Alcudia](https://www.coralboatsmallorca.com/en/alcudia-sunset-boat-tour)"

Turquoise coves, smooth sailing across the Mediterranean, views of the coastline from a different perspective and the feeling of completely disconnecting.\n\nBut there is one key detail that makes the difference between a simply good excursion and a truly unforgettable one: **being well prepared**.\n\nAt Coral Boats, we have been running boat excursions from Alcudia for years, both shared tours and private experiences. We have seen it all: guests arriving without sunscreen, others forgetting their swimwear, phones damaged by water, or travelers unsure about the right footwear.\n\nThat’s why we created this **ultimate guide on what to bring on a boat tour in Mallorca**, designed for:\n\n- Morning boat excursions in the Bay of Alcudia.\n- Sunset boat tours.\n- Private boat charters.\n\nIf you are already thinking about booking your experience, you can see all available options here: [Boat tours from Alcudia](https://www.coralboatsmallorca.com/en/boat-tours-alcudia).\n\nAnd if you are still planning your trip, this guide will help you arrive prepared and enjoy every minute at sea."

Use high-protection sunscreen, preferably water-resistant. Underestimating the sun at sea is one of the most common mistakes.\n- **Towel**: Essential if the tour includes swimming stops or time to relax in coves. Even if you don’t swim, it’s useful for comfort.\n- **Swimwear**: Wear it or pack it in your bag. Many travelers regret not bringing it once they see how clear the water is.\n- **Water**: Staying hydrated is key, especially in summer. Even if drinks are included, bringing your own bottle is always a good idea.\n- **Sunglasses**: Ideally with a strap. Sun glare on the water can be strong and uncomfortable.\n- **Camera or phone**: You’ll want to capture the experience. If you’d like inspiration beforehand, you can see real images here: [Coral Boats gallery](https://www.coralboatsmallorca.com/en/gallery).\n\nThese essentials apply to a **morning tour**, a **sunset excursion**, or a **private charter**.

The combination of the **Bay of Alcudia**, the soft Mediterranean light, and the outline of the **Serra de Tramuntana** creates a show that changes every day: oranges, golds, pinks, and purples blending across the horizon.\n\nThe best part is you don’t need to “do anything” to feel it. Just be there at the exact moment. And if you experience it **from the sea**, everything intensifies: the silence, the sun’s reflection on the water, the feeling of open space, and that mental pause that only appears once the coastline falls behind.\n\nIf you’re planning your trip, this article will help you understand:\n\n- Why an **Alcudia sunset** is one of the most recommended experiences in Mallorca.\n- The difference between watching it from the beach and seeing it **on a sunset boat**.\n- What to bring, what to expect, and how to make the most of it.\n\nTo get your bearings, here’s a practical guide to the departure point and the vibe of the area: [Port of Alcudia: complete guide](https://coralboats.com/en/blog-details/guia-puerto-alcudia-mallorca).

On the coast, buildings, beach bars, or trees can interrupt the scene. At sea, everything simplifies: horizon, sky, reflection, and a color palette that feels made for the camera.\n\nIf you’re visiting as a couple, it’s one of the most romantic options in the north of the island. If you’re traveling with family, it’s a calm (and different) plan that tends to work for all ages.

It’s also an island with a **millennia-old culinary tradition** that has blended the influences of every civilisation that has left its mark on these shores: Phoenicians, Romans, Arabs, Catalans and Castilians.\n\nMallorcan cuisine is, above all, **product-driven cooking**. Simple ingredients, honest preparations and flavours that speak of the land. Olive oil from the Serra de Tramuntana, almonds from inland fields, native black pig, dry-farmed vegetables and, of course, fresh Mediterranean fish.\n\nBut there’s something that makes tasting these flavours even more special: **doing it from the sea**. When you sail through the [Bay of Alcudia](https://coralboats.com/en/boat-tours-alcudia), with the sea breeze on your face and the sun reflecting on crystal-clear waters, every bite takes on a different dimension. It’s as if the Mediterranean goes straight to your palate.\n\nAt [Coral Boats](https://coralboats.com/en/about), we’ve spent years offering not only boat trips, but **complete experiences** where local gastronomy plays a leading role.

      "body": "To understand today’s Mallorcan cuisine, you have to go back thousands of years. The **Phoenicians**, among the first seafarers to trade along these coasts, introduced the cultivation of olive trees and vines. The **Romans** consolidated oil and wine production, turning Mallorca into an important supply hub for the Empire.\n\nBut it was the **Arab rule** (10th–13th centuries) that left an enduring footprint on the island’s gastronomy:\n\n- They introduced almond trees, now a symbol of Mallorca\n- They brought irrigation techniques that transformed agriculture\n- They contributed spices such as saffron and cinnamon\n- They developed pastry-making with honey and nuts\n\nAfter the Christian conquest in 1229, Mallorcan cooking fused this heritage with Catalan and Castilian traditions. Iconic dishes emerged, such as **frit mallorquí**, **sopes mallorquines** and **coca de trampó**.\n\nFishermen from Alcudia, Pollença and other ports developed their own culinary tradition, adapted to long days at sea. They learned how to preserve food, prepare simple yet nourishing meals, and make the most of every catch. It’s this seafaring wisdom that we reconnect with on our [boat tours](https://coralboats.com/en/boat-tours-alcudia).\n\nIf you love the history of these shores, we recommend our article on [fun facts about the Balearic coastline](https://coralboats.com/en/blog-details/curiosidades-litoral-balear-bahia-alcudia)."

You can pair it with cured ham, Mahón cheese, sobrasada, or enjoy it in its purest form.\n\nOn our [morning tours](https://coralboats.com/en/alcudia-morning-boat-tour), we serve freshly prepared pa amb oli as you sail towards the most beautiful coves in the bay."

This natural diet gives the meat a unique and incomparable flavour.\n\nThe production process is still artisanal for many makers:\n\n- Meat and fat are finely minced\n- They’re mixed with paprika (which gives its characteristic colour), salt and spices\n- The mixture is stuffed into natural casing\n- It’s cured for weeks or months, depending on thickness\n\nThe result is a creamy texture that you can spread on bread, cook with, or even pair with honey—an unexpectedly delicious combination often matched with sweet wines.\n\nFun fact: Mallorcan sobrasada has **PGI status** (Protected Geographical Indication), guaranteeing authenticity and quality. Only sobrasada made on the island using traditional methods can carry this label.\n\nLearn more about local traditions on our [About page](https://coralboats.com/en/about), where we share our philosophy of connecting visitors with authentic Mallorcan culture."

Cod (bacallà) became a staple ingredient, even though it isn’t local\n- **Simplicity**: few-ingredient dishes that were still highly nourishing, made with the limited resources available on a boat\n- **Using everything**: nothing was wasted. Small fish (morralla) went into broths and rice dishes\n- **Bread as a base**: stale bread was rehydrated with fish stock to create hearty fisherman's soups\n\nTraditional fisherman-style dishes include:\n\n- **Bullit de peix**: fish stew with potatoes, Mallorca’s cousin of bouillabaisse\n- **Arròs a banda**: rice cooked in fish broth, served separately\n- **Sepia amb trampó**: cuttlefish with the classic Mallorcan salad of tomato, green pepper and onion\n- **Escaldums de rap**: monkfish stew with almonds\n\nThis tradition is still alive around the ports of the Bay of Alcudia.

These cliffs, formed over millions of years by wind and sea erosion, reach impressive heights exceeding 300 meters in some areas.\n\n**Unique features of the northern cliffs:**\n\n- **Limestone formations** that reflect the Mediterranean light in golden and white tones\n- **Mediterranean vegetation** clinging to vertical walls: pines, oaks, and Balearic endemic plants\n- **Sea caves and grottos** carved by waves over millennia\n- **Panoramic views** extending as far as Menorca on clear days\n- **Protected marine life** thriving in the deep waters at the cliffs’ base\n\n**The phenomenon of marine erosion:**\n\nThese cliffs are the result of a fascinating geological process. The constant action of the waves, especially during winter storms, has sculpted the limestone rocks into natural arches, underwater caves, and rock formations that resemble sculptures. Some of these formations are so ancient they date back to the Mesozoic era, more than 65 million years ago.\n\n**Why these cliffs are unique in the Mediterranean:**\n\nUnlike other Mediterranean coastlines dominated by beaches and bays, Mallorca’s north coast offers one of the most dramatic coastal profiles in southern Europe.

Access may be restricted during peak season for safety reasons. **Recommended alternative:** arrive by boat from Port de Pollença or Alcudia to skip traffic and enjoy a completely different perspective.\n\n**The experience from the sea:**\n\nSeeing Cap de Formentor from a boat is a completely different experience.

Accessible only on foot (a 45-minute walk from the parking area) or by boat, this cove retains its charm precisely because of its difficult access.\n\n**Other secret coves in the area:**\n\n- **Cala Murta** – Surrounded by cliffs, with deep waters perfect for snorkeling\n- **Cala Tuent** – At the foot of Mallorca’s highest mountain, with unique dark volcanic sand\n- **Cala Bóquer** – Small and sheltered, ideal for families\n- **Cala Castell** – Near Pollença, easier access but equally stunning\n\n**Why these coves are special:**\n\nUnlike the tourist beaches of the south, these coves preserve their wild nature. No beach bars, no rows of umbrellas, no crowds. Just nature, silence (except for the sound of the waves), and a sense of discovery that’s increasingly rare in the Mediterranean.\n\n**Best time to visit:**\n\nEarly morning or late afternoon are ideal.

These meadows are not simple algae: they flower, produce oxygen, and serve as shelter for hundreds of species. Among their leaves move octopus, cuttlefish, starfish, sea urchins, and countless small fish seeking food and protection. Observing them is like watching the foundation of the entire marine food chain. Moreover, Posidonia meadows help preserve sandy beaches and filter the water, giving the bay its iconic turquoise color that fascinates visitors."

These species are typical of the Mediterranean, and their abundance is a direct indicator of ecosystem health. You can also see sponges, anemones, and small crustaceans that add vibrant color to the underwater landscape. For the curious eye, every dive becomes a new discovery in this transparent, living world.

Loggerhead turtles, a protected species, have also been sighted in these waters, visiting in search of food or rest. Occasionally, glowing jellyfish or ocean sunfish may appear on the horizon.

Here are some essential recommendations for conscious, sustainable tourism:\n\nDo not touch or disturb marine animals while snorkeling or diving, no matter how harmless they seem.\nUse biodegradable sunscreen to avoid releasing toxic substances that harm corals and Posidonia.\nDo not feed fish or alter their natural behavior — the best show is seeing them act freely.\nRespect protected zones and always follow the instructions of local guides, who know the environmental rules.\nAvoid anchoring over Posidonia meadows; a single anchor can destroy meters of vegetation that may take years to recover.\nPick up any floating plastic or waste you find. A small action can make a huge difference to marine health.\n\nEach responsible gesture adds up. Being part of this culture of respect turns every excursion into a more meaningful and authentic experience.

      "title": "A bay shaped by history: the maritime heart of northern Mallorca",
      "body": "Alcudia Bay is one of the most evocative natural settings in Mallorca, a space where geology, history and human life have converged for thousands of years. Its calm waters and natural amplitude have been, since ancient times, a strategic point for sailors, merchants, fishermen and travellers who found in this bay a safe refuge from the northeasterly winds and the complexity of the open Mediterranean.\n\nFor many visitors today, the bay is synonymous with calm, long beaches and nautical activities. However, beneath the surface lies a fascinating past, marked by civilizations that left their mark and by a landscape that has evolved constantly. The history of Alcudia Bay is not only explained through archaeological remains, but also through maritime routes, medieval chronicles, coastal settlements and a deep bond between its people and the sea.\n\nExploring this history helps to better understand the identity of the area and, at the same time, to discover a narrative that complements the current experience of those who walk along the coast, whether strolling through the harbour, visiting Alcudia’s old town or joining one of the [boat trips from Alcudia](https://coralboats.com/en/boat-tours-alcudia). Every stretch of coastline preserves a trace of that past, visible both in the natural landscape and in the traditions that still endure."

      "title": "The geological origin of the bay: a natural refuge in constant transformation",
      "body": "The bay owes much of its character to its geological configuration. Its wide curve, protected by the Cap des Pinar peninsula to the west and the Son Serra area to the east, was formed over thousands of years through sedimentary processes, tectonic movements and the constant action of wind and currents.\n\nThis natural enclave offered a key advantage to the first human communities: a sheltered space where they could beach their boats, fish safely and access marine resources without being exposed to the open Mediterranean storms. The first Talayotic populations, who were already present in the region in the Bronze Age, found here a favourable environment for settlement and mobility.\n\nOver time, sediments carried from the island’s interior formed the sandy stretches that today characterize the bay, especially in areas such as Playa de Muro. This natural process is still active; every change in the currents, every storm season and every decade brings new nuances to the coastal landscape. Even so, the bay has preserved its essence: a wide space with relatively calm waters, ideal for maritime activities such as coastal navigation, traditional fishing and, today, experiences like those we offer on our [boat excursions](https://coralboats.com/en/boat-tours-alcudia)."

      "title": "Ancient navigation: Phoenicians, Romans and the Mediterranean as a stage for exchange",
      "body": "In the early stages of Mediterranean navigation, the bay became a strategic point for expeditions that skirted the Balearic coasts. Phoenicians and Carthaginians knew this enclave and used it as a provisioning and stopover area, taking advantage of the ease of anchoring and access to coastal resources.\n\nWith the arrival of the Romans, Alcudia gained a prominent role. The founding of Pollentia in the 1st century BC, located just a few minutes from today’s old town of Alcudia, marked a turning point. The city, whose archaeological site can still be visited, became an economic and political centre, with maritime connections that used the bay as an entry and exit route for goods.\n\nFinds of amphorae, net weights, ceramics and metal objects along various points of the coast confirm that maritime activity remained constant for centuries. The bay functioned as an open natural harbour, without large infrastructures but with intensive use by fishermen, merchants and military forces.\n\nEven today, sailing along the coast —for example on a [morning boat tour around the bay](https://coralboats.com/en/tour-details/morning-tour)— offers a perspective that does not differ too much from what ancient sailors may have seen: the same line of hills, the same sandy profiles and the same feeling of shelter that shaped the maritime history of the region."

      "title": "Middle Ages and modern era: piracy, defence and the development of the port",
      "body": "During the Middle Ages, the Mediterranean experienced a turbulent period marked by piracy, commercial exchanges and struggles between powers. Alcudia Bay was no stranger to this context. Its natural conditions, so useful for trade, also attracted raids that forced local communities to develop defensive systems and organise coastal life with caution.\n\nAs maritime activity increased, small communities of fishermen and farmers emerged, depending directly on the sea. Over time, especially from the 17th and 18th centuries onwards, the port began to take shape as an economic hub, supported by traditional fishing and boat building.\n\nThe modernisation of the port in the 19th and early 20th centuries consolidated its central role in local life. The movement of goods, coastal transport and the first tourist activities shaped the character of Port d’Alcudia, which today combines history, nautical activity and a unique Mediterranean atmosphere. If you would like to explore this evolution in more detail, you can read our [Port d’Alcudia guide](https://coralboats.com/en/blog-details/guia-puerto-alcudia-mallorca), where we explain its transformation and main areas."

Underwater archaeology has made it possible to document trade routes, shipwrecks and everyday activities that were never recorded in writing but reveal the maritime pulse of antiquity.\n\nAmong the most interesting discoveries are remains of Roman boats, fragments of wine and oil amphorae, tools linked to ancient fishing practices and materials that suggest the existence of coastal workshops dedicated to ship maintenance. These pieces, often small, provide crucial information about how the bay was used and how its inhabitants related to the sea.\n\nThe combination of shallow waters and protected areas has allowed some of these remains to be preserved in exceptional conditions. For specialists, the bay is a natural laboratory in which to study ancient navigation and the evolution of maritime practices in the western Mediterranean."

Its transparent waters, fine sandy beaches and mild climate make it one of the safest and most pleasant places in the Mediterranean to enjoy with children.\n\nHowever, not all coves are the same. Some have currents, others are difficult to access, and many become crowded during high season. Knowing where to go makes the difference between a stressful day and an unforgettable one.\n\nThis guide is designed for real families: parents looking for beaches where children can splash around safely, where there is shade to rest, nearby services and, above all, where the sea is an ally rather than a concern. We will explore the family-friendly coves in Mallorca that are truly worth visiting, with special focus on the north of the island and the [Bay of Alcudia](https://coralboats.com/en/blog-details/magia-bahia-alcudia-tour-barco), one of the most recommended areas for families travelling with young children or teenagers.\n\nYou will also discover why many families choose to explore these coves from the sea, accessing less crowded spots and enjoying a completely different experience."

      "body": "Before listing specific coves, it is important to understand what makes a beach truly suitable for families. Beauty alone is not enough: it needs to be practical, safe and comfortable.\n\nThe first condition is how the water deepens. Coves with a gentle slope and shallow waters allow young children to play safely near the shore. Beaches with sudden drop-offs or rocky seabeds, although spectacular, are not ideal for small kids.\n\nWave conditions also matter. Safe coves in Mallorca are usually protected by natural formations that block the wind and reduce waves. The Bay of Alcudia, for example, acts as a large natural shelter thanks to its orientation and geography. You can check our [guide to weather and wind in Mallorca](https://coralboats.com/en/blog-details/viento-meteorologia-barco-mallorca) to better understand how these factors affect swimming and navigation.\n\nAnother key aspect is the availability of services. Some unspoilt coves are beautiful, but walking for half an hour carrying umbrellas, coolers and children can quickly become exhausting. Family-friendly beaches usually offer nearby parking, beach bars, toilets and sunbed rentals.\n\nFinally, the type of seabed matters. Fine sand is far more comfortable for little feet than pebbles or rocks. And if the water is crystal clear, even better: children enjoy spotting fish and sea plants, while parents can keep an eye on them easily.\n\nThere is no perfect cove for every family, but there are options that meet most of these requirements. Below, we present a selection of the best calm coves in Mallorca to visit with kids."

The sun is less intense, beaches are quieter, and children are usually more rested and receptive. After midday, the heat increases and finding shade becomes harder.\n\nAs for what to bring, in addition to the basics (sunscreen, towels, water and food), water shoes are highly recommended, especially for rocky coves. A bucket and spade for the sand always work, and for slightly older children, snorkelling goggles can turn a swim into an underwater adventure.\n\nIf you plan to spend the whole day, look for beaches with natural shade or bring a large umbrella. Children tire easily under direct sun, and having a cool place to rest is essential.\n\nWind is another factor to consider. In Mallorca, days with northern winds (Tramuntana) can make some coves choppier than usual. The Bay of Alcudia is generally protected, but other parts of the island may be affected. Always check the forecast before heading out.\n\nAnd if you want something different, consider exploring the coves by boat. It is a way to avoid roads, parking issues and long walks with heavy gear. Plus, children absolutely love the experience of sailing."

      "title": "Why discovering Mallorca’s coves by boat with kids makes a difference",
      "body": "There is a huge difference between reaching a cove by car and arriving by boat. When travelling with children, that difference becomes even more significant.\n\nOn a boat, there is no need to carry coolers, umbrellas or bags. Everything is on board, and the crew ensures the experience is comfortable and safe. Children can move around the deck, observe the sea, watch how the boat is handled and feel part of the adventure.\n\nIn addition, coves accessed by boat are usually far less crowded. While easily accessible beaches fill up by midday, remote coves remain peaceful. For families, that means more space, more calm and a much more relaxed experience.\n\nAnother important aspect is flexibility. If a cove is too busy or uncomfortable due to wind, the boat can move to another spot within minutes — something a car simply cannot offer.\n\nAt Coral Boats, we have spent years organising [family excursions around the Bay of Alcudia](https://coralboats.com/en/boat-tours-alcudia). Our classic boats are prepared to welcome families with children of all ages, offering life jackets, shaded areas and a crew experienced in making sure kids enjoy the trip as much as adults.\n\nYou can choose between our [morning tour](https://coralboats.com/en/tour-details/morning-tour), ideal for families with young children who prefer early starts and avoiding midday heat, or our [full-day tour](https://coralboats.com/en/tour-details/day-tour), which includes more stops and extra time to explore.\n\nWe also offer [sunset excursions](https://coralboats.com/en/tour-details/sunset-tour), perfect for families with older children who want to experience the magic of watching the sun set over the sea — a memory that lasts a lifetime."

      "title": "What to expect from a boat excursion with kids in the Bay of Alcudia",
      "body": "For families who have never taken a boat trip with children, it is natural to have questions. Will they feel seasick? Will they be safe? Will they get bored?\n\nThe reality is that children usually love these experiences. The Bay of Alcudia offers calm waters, which greatly reduces the risk of seasickness. The movement of the boat is gentle and relaxed, without sudden jolts or high speeds.\n\nIn terms of safety, our boats are fully equipped: life jackets for all sizes, secure railings and a professional crew supervising at all times. You can read more about [what to bring on a boat tour](https://coralboats.com/en/blog-details/que-llevar-a-un-tour-en-barco-mallorca) to prepare your children properly.\n\nAs for boredom, experience shows it is the least of your worries. Between enjoying the scenery, spotting fish, swimming in hidden coves, snorkelling and taking part in small onboard activities, time flies by.\n\nMany families who initially have reservations end up returning year after year. For children, a day on a boat is a real adventure — something to share with friends and remember for a long time."

Its safe, family-friendly coves, crystal-clear waters and gentle climate do the rest. You just have to let yourself go.\n\nIf you are planning a family holiday and want to include something more than the typical beach day, we invite you to explore the options we offer at [Coral Boats](https://coralboats.com/en/boat-tours-alcudia).

      "title": "Mallorca from the sea: why choosing the right tour makes all the difference",
      "body": "Mallorca has over 550 kilometres of coastline. Hidden coves, dramatic cliffs, white-sand beaches, sea caves, uninhabited islets and harbours with centuries of history. It’s all there, waiting to be discovered. And the best way to do it is, without a doubt, from the water.\n\nBut not all boat tours are the same. The experience you have will depend heavily on the area you choose, the type of vessel, the duration of the route and what you’re truly looking for: adventure or relaxation? wild coves or mountain scenery? a full day or a few hours at sunset?\n\nThis guide exists to help you make that decision with real, useful information. It’s not a list of companies or a price comparison. It’s a tour of every area in Mallorca where you can take a boat trip, explaining what each one offers, what kind of experience you can expect and who it’s best for.\n\nIf you’re planning your trip to Mallorca and want it to include a boat excursion, keep reading.

      "title": "What to consider before choosing a boat tour",
      "body": "Before looking at each area, it helps to be clear on a few criteria that will allow you to filter options and avoid disappointment.\n\n**The type of boat matters.** A party catamaran with music and open bar is not the same as a traditional Mallorcan llaut with limited capacity. A fast speedboat is different from a slow sailboat. Every vessel creates a different atmosphere: always ask what type of boat is used and how many people will be on board.\n\n**Duration defines the route.** A two-hour tour barely allows you to leave the harbour and make a short stop. A half-day tour (3–4 hours) gives you time to explore several coves at a relaxed pace. Full-day tours (6–8 hours) are the ones that truly let you reach remote areas, stop multiple times to swim and even eat on board.\n\n**Time of day changes the experience.** Morning tours usually bring calmer waters and fewer people in the coves. Midday tours coincide with the strongest heat. Sunset tours are ideal for romance, photography and spectacular colours, although swimming time is usually more limited.\n\n**Wind and sea conditions.** Mallorca is exposed to several prevailing winds that affect each coast differently. Tramuntana (north wind) tends to roughen the north and west coasts. Llevant (east wind) impacts the eastern coast. Embat is the summer thermal sea breeze that often keeps the Bay of Palma and the Bay of Alcudia relatively calm. Always ask whether the tour can be cancelled or adjusted due to weather, and whether alternatives exist.\n\n**Your traveller profile.** Are you travelling as a couple looking for peace and quiet? As a family with young children? With friends looking for a party? Solo and hoping to meet people? Each area and tour style attracts a different crowd. Being honest with yourself about what you want will save you surprises."

    "section3": {
      "title": "Boat tours in the Bay of Palma: the most accessible option",
      "body": "The Bay of Palma is the most popular starting point for boat excursions in Mallorca. Its proximity to the airport, the concentration of hotels and the port infrastructure make it the area with the widest offer.\n\n**What you can expect:**\n\n- Departures from the Port of Palma, Portixol, Can Pastilla or El Arenal\n- Routes heading east (Cala Blava, Cala Pi) or west (Illetes, Portals)\n- A huge range of vessels, from large party catamarans to private yachts\n- Short tours (2–3 hours) that are often budget-friendly\n- A more touristy, crowded feel in high season\n\n**Who it’s ideal for:**\n\nThe Bay of Palma is perfect if you’re short on time, staying in the south of the island, or you want a first boat experience with minimal logistics. It’s also the best option if you’re looking for a party tour with music and a lively vibe, as the highest concentration of party boats is here.\n\n**What to keep in mind:**\n\nThe coves in this area are beautiful, but they’re not the most spectacular on the island. The water is clean, but the number of boats in summer can reduce the sense of charm. If you’re looking for exclusivity or wild nature, consider other areas.\n\nTo better understand the differences between boat types, you can check our [comparative guide to vessels](https://coralboats.com/en/blog-details/excursiones-barco-mallorca-guia-completa)."

This is where you’ll find some of the most exclusive coves and the most dramatic coastal scenery.\n\n**What you can expect:**\n\n- Departures from Santa Ponça, Paguera, Port d'Andratx or Sant Elm\n- Turquoise-water coves such as Cala Llamp, Cala Egos and Camp de Mar\n- Views of Sa Dragonera island (a natural park)\n- Impressive cliffs and rich marine life\n- A calmer atmosphere than the Bay of Palma\n- The possibility of tours to Sa Dragonera with a landing\n\n**Who it’s ideal for:**\n\nThis area is perfect for travellers looking for spectacular scenery, less crowded coves and a more relaxed pace. It’s highly recommended for couples, families and small groups who value quality over quantity. Tours to Sa Dragonera are especially appealing for nature lovers.\n\n**What to keep in mind:**\n\nThe west-facing coast is more exposed to westerly and southwesterly winds. On stormy days, tours may be cancelled or rerouted. Port d'Andratx is one of the most beautiful ports in Mallorca, so it’s worth arriving early to enjoy a stroll before boarding.\n\nIf you decide to explore this area, make sure to choose an operator who knows the local conditions well and can adapt the itinerary based on the wind."

It’s a full-day excursion that requires an early start, but the reward is worth it. Ideal for families with children aged 6–7+ (roughly), couples and anyone who values protected natural areas.\n\n**What to keep in mind:**\n\nAs it’s a national park, places are limited and you should book in advance, especially in July and August. The crossing can be choppy if it’s windy, so take precautions if you’re prone to seasickness. There are no dining services on the island beyond what your boat provides.\n\nIt’s one of the most authentic experiences you can have in Mallorca.

The best tours (small groups, morning departures) sell out weeks ahead. If you’re travelling then, don’t leave your booking for the last day.\n\n**Read real reviews.** Google Reviews, TripAdvisor and reviews on booking platforms will give you a clear idea of what to expect. Look at recent comments and how operators respond to criticism.\n\n**Ask about group size.** A catamaran with 80 people and a llaut with 12 offer completely different experiences. If you value tranquillity, look for operators that limit capacity.\n\n**Confirm what’s included in the price.** Drinks, food, snorkelling gear, towels — each operator has different policies. Make sure you know what’s included to avoid surprises.\n\n**Have a weather plan B.** The sea is in charge. If your tour is cancelled due to bad weather, do you get a refund? A reschedule? Do they offer flexibility? Ask before booking.\n\n**Consider where you’re staying.** If you’re based in the north, it rarely makes sense to travel all the way to Palma for a tour. Make the most of the area you’re in and save transfer time.\n\n**Listen to your body.** If you’re prone to seasickness, avoid windy days and long tours in open water. Sheltered bays (Alcudia, Pollença, Palma) are usually more stable."

Whether you come looking for postcard beaches, medieval villages, Mediterranean gastronomy, or adventures at sea, this island has something for every kind of traveler. And the best part is: three days are enough to discover its essence.\n\nThree days may sound like little time, but if you use them well, they’ll let you experience the diversity that makes Mallorca unique.

      "title": "Before you start: key tips to plan your Mallorca route",
      "body": "Before getting into the day-by-day plan, there are a few strategic decisions that will make a real difference to your experience. Mallorca has over 550 kilometers of coastline and a very varied geography, so planning well will save you time and help you enjoy more.\n\nThe first important decision is where to stay. If you only have three days, we recommend choosing one base and doing day trips from there rather than changing hotels every night. Palma is the most practical option if you want to combine city, beach, and excursions. The north of the island (Alcudia, Pollença, Port of Alcudia) is ideal if you prioritize nature, family-friendly beaches, and water activities. You can check our [guide on where to stay in Mallorca](https://coralboats.com/en/blog-details/donde-alojarse-mallorca-mejores-zonas) to decide which area best fits your style.\n\nTransport is another key factor. A rental car gives you full freedom to follow this itinerary at your own pace. Mallorca’s roads are in good condition, although some Tramuntana areas have sharp curves. If you don’t want to drive, there are good bus connections between the main towns, but you’ll lose flexibility.\n\nAs for the time of year: Mallorca enjoys a privileged climate almost year-round. May to October is ideal for beaches and water activities. July and August are the busiest and hottest months. September is possibly the perfect month: great weather, fewer tourists, and the sea still warm. In winter, the island has a different charm—ideal for hiking, villages, and gastronomy.\n\nOne last recommendation: don’t try to see everything. Mallorca rewards those who take their time. It’s better to enjoy a few things calmly than to rush from place to place without truly savoring any of them. This itinerary is designed with that spirit: balance between discovery and enjoyment."

Palma is much more than the airport and beach hotels: it’s a city with soul, history, and a cultural life that surprises anyone who ventures into its streets.\n\nMorning is the best time to explore the old town. Start with Mallorca Cathedral, known as La Seu, a Gothic masterpiece that rises impressively over the bay. Its interior, partly redesigned by Gaudí, has a special light early in the morning. Right next door is the Royal Palace of La Almudaina, the former residence of the kings of Mallorca.\n\nFrom the cathedral, get lost in the streets of the historic center. The Jewish quarter (Call Jueu) preserves a labyrinth of narrow alleys where time seems to stand still.

It’s the perfect day to combine nature, beaches, and charming towns.\n\nIf you slept in Palma, the drive to Alcudia takes around an hour. The road crosses the island’s interior, past almond groves and vineyards, offering a different perspective of Mallorca.\n\nYour first stop is the town of Alcudia. Its old town, surrounded by 14th-century medieval walls, is one of the best preserved on the island. Stroll its cobbled streets, step into Gothic churches, and walk up on the walls for panoramic views. On Tuesdays and Sundays there’s a traditional market—one of the most authentic on Mallorca.\n\nFrom Alcudia, head down to the port. The [Port of Alcudia](https://coralboats.com/en/blog-details/guia-puerto-alcudia-mallorca) is the starting point for some of the island’s best sea experiences. This is where we operate at Coral Boats, and where we recommend one of the most special moments of your trip: a boat trip across the [Bay of Alcudia](https://coralboats.com/en/blog-details/magia-bahia-alcudia-tour-barco).\n\nThe waters in this bay are exceptionally calm and crystal-clear, protected by the area’s natural geography. It’s the perfect place to swim in coves that are only accessible from the sea, snorkel over posidonia seagrass meadows, and discover spots like Coll Baix or the islet of Alcanada with its historic lighthouse.

It’s a completely different way to experience the coast, far from crowded beaches.\n\nIf you’re traveling as a family, the Bay of Alcudia is especially recommended for its [calm, kid-safe waters](https://coralboats.com/en/blog-details/planes-barco-familias-ninos-mallorca). If you’re traveling as a couple and want something more romantic, our [sunset excursion](https://coralboats.com/en/tour-details/sunset-tour) offers a magical experience as the sun sets over the Serra de Tramuntana."

It winds along cliffs until you reach the lighthouse at the island’s northern tip. The views are stunning, especially at sunset. In summer, car access is restricted during certain hours, so plan ahead or consider arriving by boat.\n\nFor dinner, head back to Port de Pollença and choose a restaurant along the seafront.

Expect winding roads, plenty of photo stops, and the feeling of discovering a world apart.\n\nIf you’re coming from the north of the island, your first stop can be Lluc, Mallorca’s most important monastery. Set in a valley surrounded by mountains, it’s a pilgrimage site and also a starting point for hiking trails. The surroundings are spectacular, and there’s a special calm that invites reflection.\n\nFrom Lluc, the road descends toward the west coast.

It’s the only natural port on the west coast and has a completely different vibe from the east: more intimate, more sheltered, with the charm of places that live outside mass tourism.\n\nHere you can have lunch at one of the port restaurants, swim at the small beach, or simply stroll along the promenade.

The village is beautiful, with cobbled streets decorated with flowerpots and a special light that has inspired painters for centuries. It’s very popular, so try to arrive early in the morning or at sunset.\n\nIn both villages you’ll find local craft shops, art galleries, and restaurants with terraces overlooking the valley.

Cala Deià is small and rocky, but it has a special charm. Lluc Alcari, a bit further north, is even smaller and quieter.\n\nThe return to Palma (if it’s your base) or to the airport can be done via the highway crossing the island, much faster than the mountain road.

Here are a few variations you can incorporate.\n\nIf you prioritize beaches and the sea, consider spending two days in the north of the island instead of one. The [Bay of Alcudia](https://coralboats.com/en/blog-details/curiosidades-litoral-balear-bahia-alcudia) has kilometers of coastline to explore, and combining a beach day with a [boat trip](https://coralboats.com/en/boat-tours-alcudia) will let you discover coves that would otherwise be inaccessible. You can check our [family-friendly cove guide](https://coralboats.com/en/blog-details/calas-ninos-mallorca-playas-familiares) if you’re traveling with kids.\n\nIf you’re interested in history and culture, add a visit to Artà (in the east of the island), with its medieval fortress and prehistoric caves. Or spend more time in inland villages like Sineu, Petra, or Montuïri, where tourism has barely arrived and you can experience the most authentic Mallorca.\n\nIf you love hiking, the Serra de Tramuntana offers routes for all levels. The Camí de s'Arxiduc, near Valldemossa, is one of the most popular. Torrent de Pareis, ending at Sa Calobra, is more demanding but spectacular. And the GR 221, the Ruta de Pedra en Sec, crosses the entire mountain range for the more adventurous.\n\nIf you’re traveling as a couple and looking for romance, consider a night in one of Deià or Sóller’s boutique hotels. Dining under the stars in a mountain village and waking up to Mediterranean views is hard to beat. And for a special evening, our [sunset excursion](https://coralboats.com/en/blog-details/puesta-de-sol-alcudia-mar-inolvidable) from the Port of Alcudia is one of the most romantic experiences on the island.\n\nIf you have a bit more time, a fourth day could be dedicated to an excursion to Cabrera National Park, a protected archipelago south of Mallorca with the clearest waters in the Balearics. It requires booking in advance, but it’s one of the most impressive natural experiences in the Mediterranean."

Hotels and apartments with great views or prime locations sell out quickly. Consider agritourism options inland if you want something different—traditional fincas converted into hotels with pools and absolute tranquility.\n\nRental car: pick it up at the airport for convenience. Full-coverage insurance is worth it if you’re not used to mountain roads. Parking in Palma is tricky; use public garages or leave the car at your hotel and get around on foot or by public transport.\n\nReservations: popular restaurants (especially in Palma, Deià, and Sóller) can fill up in high season. Book ahead if there’s a specific place you really want. The same applies to boat trips: [small-group tours](https://coralboats.com/en/blog-details/excursion-barco-privada-o-compartida) often sell out days or even weeks in advance.\n\nWhat to pack: beyond beach essentials, bring comfortable shoes for walking on cobbled streets, something warm for mountain evenings (even in summer), and high-SPF sun protection. If you plan to snorkel, you can bring your own gear or rent it; we provide equipment on all our [excursions](https://coralboats.com/en/boat-tours-alcudia). Check our [guide on what to bring on a boat tour](https://coralboats.com/en/blog-details/que-llevar-a-un-tour-en-barco-mallorca) for more details.\n\nWeather: check the forecast before choosing the day for your boat excursion or your Tramuntana visit. Wind can change sea conditions and cause some activities to be canceled. Read our [wind and weather guide](https://coralboats.com/en/blog-details/viento-meteorologia-barco-mallorca) to understand how conditions can affect your plans.\n\nFood: don’t leave Mallorca without trying pa amb oli (bread with olive oil and tomato), sobrasada, tumbet, vegetable cocas, arroz brut, and ensaïmada. Traditional markets are the best place to buy local products. And if you’re interested in the onboard food experience, on our excursions we serve [typical Mallorcan snacks](https://coralboats.com/en/blog-details/sabores-mediterraneos-en-barco) that perfectly complement a day at sea."

Getting lost in the streets of a medieval village without knowing exactly where you’re going. Watching the sun sink into the Mediterranean from a cliff with a glass of local wine in hand.\n\nYou can’t buy these experiences as part of a tourist package.

To the south, Palma is 50–60 minutes away and Sóller around 45 minutes.\n\nThese times are approximate and can vary significantly in high season (July–August), when roads to popular beaches and the Serra de Tramuntana become congested. The road to Cap de Formentor, for example, has access restrictions in summer precisely due to overcrowding.\n\nWith this mental map, you can start planning.

A one-week rental in August, with full insurance, can easily be around €400–600.\n\n**Is it worth it?** If you plan to move around a lot, visit the Tramuntana, explore coves in the east and north, and want total flexibility, yes. A car gives you access to experiences that would otherwise be impossible or very complicated. If your plan is more relaxed (hotel beach, an organized excursion, walks around town), you might be able to skip the car and save that money for other experiences."

The wooden carriages keep the charm of the early 20th century. It’s more of a tourist attraction than a practical transport option, but if you visit Sóller, taking this train is a unique experience.\n\n**From Sóller, a historic tram** (also wooden) goes down to Port de Sóller in about 20 minutes, passing through orange and lemon groves.\n\n**Prices** are approximately €25 round trip for the Palma–Sóller train, and about €8 round trip for the Sóller–Port de Sóller tram. Combined tickets are also available. It’s recommended to book in advance in high season, as the train has limited capacity and is very popular."

You can consider transfers for specific days if you don’t want to drive.\n\n**If you don’t want to worry about anything**, the winning combination is: airport–hotel transfer, organized excursions with transport included, and taxis for occasional trips. **If you’re on a tight budget**, the TIB bus can take you almost everywhere.

      "title": "Practical tips from those who know the island",
      "body": "After years welcoming travelers in the Port of Alcudia, we’ve learned a few things that can save you time and headaches.\n\n**About traffic:** On Saturdays in July and August, the road from the airport to the north gets congested in the morning (arrivals) and towards the south in the afternoon (departures), so plan with extra time. The Cap de Formentor road has access restrictions in summer: check before you go or consider arriving by boat or bus. On Sunday mornings there’s a market in Alcudia and Pollença, and parking is almost impossible if you arrive late.\n\n**About parking:** In the Port of Alcudia there is free parking a 5-minute walk from the marina; if you arrive early, you’ll find a spot without a problem. In Palma, use public parking garages like the Cathedral parking or Plaza Mayor parking, which are central. In Tramuntana villages, start early if you want to park near the center.\n\n**About fuel:** There are gas stations in all tourist areas. Some close on Sundays, but self-service stations work 24/7. Prices are similar to the rest of Spain, slightly below the European average.\n\n**About driving:** Local drivers know the roads and can drive fast; if you feel pressured, use pull-outs to let them pass. In the Tramuntana, yield to tourist buses on tight bends because they can’t maneuver easily. Watch out for cyclists, especially on mountain roads: respect safe passing distance.\n\n**About public transport:** Google Maps works well for planning bus routes. Carry cash to pay the driver if you don’t have an intermodal card. In summer, tourist buses can be full, so leave extra time."

Materials had to be transported by mule along barely existing paths, in an area so isolated that lighthouse keepers lived almost completely cut off from the world for months at a time.\n\nThe light of the lighthouse reaches 20 nautical miles (around 37 kilometres), guiding ships navigating between Mallorca and Menorca along one of the busiest passages in the western Mediterranean. For decades, lighthouse keepers and their families lived in the buildings attached to the lighthouse, leading a life of isolation that is hard to imagine today.\n\nThe lighthouse was automated in 1962, bringing an end to nearly a century of permanent human presence. Today, its light still turns on every night, but the former keepers’ houses remain empty, silent witnesses to a way of life that no longer exists.\n\nWhat has not changed is its power of attraction.

The aim is to reduce congestion on a road that was simply not designed to handle the volume of traffic it receives during peak season.\n\nDuring these hours, the only way to reach the lighthouse is by using the **shuttle bus** that departs from Port de Pollensa or from the designated parking area. The service costs around €3–5 per trip and runs at regular intervals.\n\n**Ways to avoid the restrictions:**\n- Go early: if you arrive before 10:00 am, you can access the road by car without any issues.\n- Go at sunset: after 7:00 pm, the road reopens (and this coincides with the best light for photography).\n- Visit out of season: in spring or autumn, access is unrestricted and there are far fewer visitors.\n- Arrive by boat: several companies offer boat excursions from Port de Pollensa or Port d’Alcudia that approach the Formentor coast from the sea."

      "title": "There is something almost magical about paddling standing up on the sea",
      "body": "Imagine this: it's eight in the morning in the Bay of Alcudia. The sun has just peeked out from behind the mountains of Artà, tinting the water a pale pink that seems unreal. There is no wind. The sea is a perfect mirror reflecting the sky. And there you are, standing on a paddle surf board, gliding in silence over waters so crystalline that you can see every stone on the bottom, every fish passing beneath your feet.\n\nThat is **paddle surf in Alcudia**. Or rather, that is paddle surf in Alcudia when you do it right: choosing the right time, the right place, and letting yourself be carried away by one of the most special experiences you can live in Mallorca.\n\n**Stand up paddle** (SUP) has revolutionized the way we connect with the sea. You don't need waves like in traditional surfing. You don't need a motor like on jet skis. You only need a board, a paddle, and a desire to explore. It is accessible to almost anyone, from six-year-old children to seventy-year-old grandparents. And yet, it can take you to places you would otherwise never discover.\n\nIn Mallorca, paddle surf has gone from being a rarity to becoming one of the most popular water activities. And there is a reason: few areas of the Mediterranean offer the conditions you find here. Calm waters, perfect temperature for most of the year, hidden coves that you can only reach by paddling, and a coastline that seems designed to be explored board by board.\n\nBut not all spots are the same. Not all hours of the day are good. And not all times of the year work the same. That's why we created this guide: so that your **SUP experience in Alcudia** is exactly as you imagine it. Or better.\n\nIt doesn't matter if you've never stepped on a board or if you've been paddling half the world for years. In the next few lines, you're going to discover why northern Mallorca is a top destination for paddle surf, which are the best spots for all levels, what equipment you need, and how you can combine SUP with a boat experience that multiplies the possibilities. Get ready to paddle."

      "title": "Why Alcudia is a paddle surf paradise in the Mediterranean",
      "body": "There are many places in the world where you can paddle surf. There are few where you can do it in such perfect conditions as in the **Bay of Alcudia**. And it’s no coincidence: the geography of this area in northern Mallorca seems specifically designed for this sport.\n\nThe [Bay of Alcudia](https://coralboats.com/en/blog-details/magia-bahia-alcudia-tour-barco) is the largest bay in Mallorca, an arc of nearly 30 kilometers stretching from Cap des Pinar to Colònia de Sant Pere. This configuration creates an area naturally protected from the prevailing winds, especially the Tramuntana that can blow strongly in other parts of the island.\n\nBut there is something else that makes this area special for paddle surf, something that goes beyond technical conditions. It’s the feeling of paddling over a natural aquarium. The waters of the Bay of Alcudia have a clarity that seems unreal, especially early in the morning before the wind moves the surface. You see fish swimming several meters below you. You distinguish the dark patches of posidonia alternating with patches of white sand. On good days, visibility can exceed 30 meters.\n\nThat transparency turns every stroke into something more than exercise. It is meditation in motion. It is exploration. It is connecting with the Mediterranean in a way you can't experience from a beach sunbed."

      "sub1": {
        "subtitle": "Calm waters protected from the wind",
        "body": "The orientation of the bay towards the east means that north and west winds arrive very attenuated. The Serra de Tramuntana acts as a natural barrier, protecting the coast from the strongest gusts. This translates into days with the sea practically flat, ideal for paddling whether you are a beginner or looking for long touring sessions.\n\nEven on days with moderate wind, there are always more sheltered areas of the bay where conditions are manageable. It’s a matter of knowing the spots and knowing how to read the weather report."

This combination has several advantages for SUP: impossible turquoise waters, spectacular bottoms to observe while paddling, and no risk if you fall off the board.\n\nThe posidonia, besides being an indicator of the marine ecosystem's health, creates those color contrasts between deep blue (posidonia) and bright turquoise (sand) that make these waters so photogenic. Paddling over a posidonia meadow on a sunny day is like flying over an underwater forest."

This six-month window greatly expands the SUP season compared to Northern European destinations.\n\nIn addition, the Bay of Alcudia has dozens of water access points. From the urban beaches of [Port d'Alcudia](https://coralboats.com/en/blog-details/que-hacer-en-alcudia-planes-imprescindibles) to the [most hidden coves](https://coralboats.com/en/blog-details/calas-secretas-norte-mallorca), there is always a place nearby to put your board in the water without complications."

The fine sand bottom is free of rocks or obstacles, and there are multiple equipment rental points along the beach.\n\n**Recommended route**: Depart from the Es Braç area and paddle parallel to the coast northwards, towards Port d'Alcudia.

It's barely a 400-meter crossing, but crossing that stretch of open sea on paddle surf has a bit of adventure to it. Once on the island, you can circle it completely enjoying the views of the lighthouse.\n\n**Level required**: Intermediate. You need to know how to paddle with crosswinds and have confidence in waters where you can't touch the bottom.\n\n**Important note**: The crossing to the island is short but can get complicated if the wind changes.

The thermal wind (embat) usually blows from the south-southwest, sometimes with intensity. It's not impossible to paddle, but it requires more experience.\n\n**Sunset (18:00-20:00)**: When the sun goes down, the wind usually drops.

For coves and SUP yoga, wide and stable boards.\n\n**The paddle**: It should reach approximately the height of your wrist with your arm stretched upwards. Aluminum paddles are cheaper, carbon fiber ones are lighter and more efficient.\n\n**The leash**: The strap that attaches the board to your ankle. Essential, non-negotiable. If you fall with wind, the board can drift away faster than you can swim.\n\n**Complementary equipment**: Water-resistant sun protection (the sun's reflection on the sea is brutal), sunglasses with a strap, hat or visor, enough water (minimum 1 liter), waterproof bag for mobile and keys, water shoes if you are going to explore rocky areas.\n\n**Rental in Alcudia**: In high season you will find rental points all over Playa de Muro and Playa de Alcudia. Approximate prices: €15-20 per hour, €40-60 per full day. If you plan several sessions, weekly rental is much cheaper."

You can paddle 5 kilometers, maybe 10 if you are fit. But the most spectacular coves, those that appear in Instagram photos and look like they're from another planet, are often further than you can reach by paddling.\n\n**That’s where the boat comes in.** Imagine arriving by boat at a hidden cove, anchoring in turquoise waters, and then indeed, taking out the board and exploring every corner of that cove at your own pace, entering caves, skirting cliffs, reaching where the boat cannot go.\n\nOn all our [boat excursions](https://coralboats.com/en/boat-tours-alcudia), whether it’s the [morning tour](https://coralboats.com/en/alcudia-morning-boat-tour) or the [sunset tour](https://coralboats.com/en/alcudia-sunset-boat-tour), we carry **paddle surf boards on board available to all our clients at no additional cost**. You don't need to bring anything, you don't need to rent separately, you don't need to be an expert.\n\nWhen we reach the coves where we anchor, we simply put the boards in the water and anyone who wants can use them. If you've never tried SUP, **our crew will be happy to teach you the basics**. In five minutes, you'll be standing up paddling on your own.\n\nThis combination allows you to access coves you couldn't reach otherwise, paddle in completely virgin waters, and try paddle surf without commitment. All included in the price of the excursion."

They usually operate from 9:00 to 21:00 in summer (shorter hours in winter). You need a ticket from the parking meter visible on the dashboard. The maximum time is usually 2 hours and prices range from €1.20-€2.50/hour depending on the area.\n\n**→ Orange Zone**: Some streets have this signage indicating special restrictions, such as loading and unloading or residents. Pay close attention to the signs.\n\n**→ White Zone**: The holy grail. Free spaces with no time limit. They exist, although you have to know where to look for them.\n\n**→ Private Car Parks**: Several paid car parks managed by private companies. More expensive but they guarantee a space.\n\nAn important detail: **Alcudia Town Hall does not charge for ORA on Sundays or public holidays** in most areas.

If you arrive before 9:30 or after 18:00, you will find a spot without problems.\n**→ Sundays are your ally**: There is no paid blue zone, so all regulated spaces become free. It's the best day to come by car.\n**→ The second row always has a gap**: The front line of any area is full, but it's enough to go one or two streets inland to find a spot. Walking 5 extra minutes is worth it.\n**→ Use the commercial dock parking**: It's large, has free zones, and is exactly where the boat tours and ferries leave. Most tourists don't know about it because they go straight to the promenade.\n**→ Out of season, everything is easier**: From October to May, parking in Alcudia is a piece of cake.\n**→ Watch out for fines**: The local police are quite active in high season. If you leave the car in a blue zone without a ticket or exceed the time, the fine will arrive. It's not worth the risk."

      "body": "Mallorca has more than 50 municipalities and practically all of them hold a weekly market. But they are not just any markets. The **street markets of Mallorca** have characteristics that make them unique in the Mediterranean:\n\n**→ The mix of local product and craftsmanship**: Unlike the purely tourist markets of other areas, in Mallorca, the farmer's fruit and vegetable stalls coexist with traditional craftsmanship. You can buy some 'ramallet' tomatoes right next to a piece of handmade ceramic.\n\n**→ The location in historical centers**: Many markets are held within walled enclosures or in centuries-old squares. Strolling among the stalls is also strolling through the history of the island.\n\n**→ The survival of traditional trades**: You will still find artisans working with blown glass, 'telas de lenguas' (tongue fabrics), leather, or ceramics with techniques that have not changed in generations.\n\n**→ The social atmosphere**: For Mallorcans, market day is still a social event. It is where you meet your neighbor, where you discuss the village news, where you have a mid-morning vermouth. That atmosphere is part of the experience.\n\nThe most touristy markets (Alcudia, Pollença, Sineu) have more souvenir stalls, but even in them, you can find authentic products if you know how to look. The markets in small inland villages are more local but have less variety. Ideally, you should combine both types during your stay."

In high season there are more than 200 stalls, so set aside at least a couple of hours to explore it calmly.\n\n**Opening hours**: From 8:30 to 13:30 approximately (stalls start packing up around 13:00).\n\n**Tip**: Arrive early.

Quality varies a lot, so look carefully before buying.\n\n**→ Clothing and accessories**: There are many stalls for clothes, bags, and costume jewelry, mixed with more artisanal products.\n\n**→ Flowers and plants**: Several stalls sell Mediterranean plants, fresh flowers, and aromatic herbs."

The authentic ones are 100% cotton and are made on traditional looms. They are used for tablecloths, cushions, bags... and are a gift with soul.\n\n**→ The siurells gentleman**: Siurells are the white clay figurines with touches of colors typical of Mallorca. Originally they were whistles for children. Look for a stall where they are made by hand, not factory-made ones.\n\n**→ The almond product stalls**: Candied almonds, turrón, gató (the typical almond cake), almond milk...

Originally they were children's whistles for folk festivals. The artisanal ones are made in Sa Cabaneta and Pòrtol. Factory-made ones, in China. Look at the finish: artisanal ones have small imperfections.\n\n**→ Pòrtol Ceramics**: The village of Pòrtol, near Palma, has had a pottery tradition for centuries. Look for red clay pieces with traditional glazing. They are robust, functional and beautiful.\n\n**→ Blown Glass**: Mallorca has historic blown glass factories (Gordiola, Lafiore, Menestralia). Authentic pieces are unique. If you see dozens of identical pieces, they are probably not artisanal.\n\n**→ Olive wood objects**: Bowls, boards, spoons...

At 9:00 you have a quiet market and fresh goods. At 12:00, the noise is considerable and the best has already been sold.\n\n**→ Bring cash**: Many small stalls do not accept cards. Have spare euros to avoid being told \"I don't have change.\"\n\n**→ Taste before you buy**: At the cold meat and cheese stalls, it is normal to ask for a taste. Don't be shy. It's the only way to know if you like that specific type of sobrasada.\n\n**→ Ask where the product is from**: \"Açò és de Mallorca?\" (Is this from Mallorca?) is a perfectly normal question. Honest sellers will tell you the truth; those who look at you weirdly are probably selling imported product.\n\n**→ Haggle wisely**: At craft and clothing stalls, you can try to negotiate a little, especially if you buy several pieces. At food stalls, the price is usually fixed.\n\n**→ Don't buy the first thing you see**: Go all the way around the market before buying. This way you will see the variety, compare prices and find that special stall that you would have missed.\n\n**→ Have a coffee among the stalls**: Mallorcan markets have traditional bars where locals make a stop. Ordering a \"tallat\" (espresso macchiato) and observing the atmosphere is part of the experience."

      "body": "Many travelers who arrive in Mallorca pass through Alcudia on their way to the beach, spend an hour in the old town, and leave thinking they have seen it all. Mistake. Alcudia is one of those places that needs a full day to reveal itself: its medieval walls hide corners that do not appear on the first walk, the port has a life of its own that deserves time, and the best moments arrive when the afternoon light turns stone into gold.\n\nIn this article, we propose a complete itinerary to make the most of Alcudia in one day, from the first morning coffee inside the walls to a sunset that, if everything goes well, you will remember for a long time. No rush, no endless lists of monuments, just enjoying each stop as it deserves.\n\nIf you already know the area, you might want to take a look at our guide on [what to do in Alcudia](https://coralboats.com/en/blog-details/que-hacer-en-alcudia-planes-imprescindibles) to complement your visit with more plans. And if it is your first time, you are in the right place: we are going to tell you about Alcudia as those of us who live here know it."

      "title": "Why Alcudia deserves a full day",
      "body": "Alcudia is not a big town. You can walk through its old town in twenty minutes if you are in a hurry. But that is the trap: in a hurry, you see nothing.\n\nWhat makes Alcudia special is the density of interesting things concentrated in a small space. In just a few hundred meters, you have **14th-century medieval walls** that you can walk along, a **Gothic church** that looks like a fortress, cobbled streets with stone houses that have stood for five hundred years, Roman remains under your feet, and squares where life still follows the slow rhythm of the Mediterranean.\n\nAnd then there is the port. Just five minutes by car (or a pleasant twenty-minute walk), the [Port of Alcudia](https://coralboats.com/en/blog-details/guia-puerto-alcudia-mallorca) offers a complete change of scenery: a seaside promenade, terraces facing the sea, fishing boats, and, if you feel like it, the chance to sail in one of the most beautiful bays in the Mediterranean.\n\nCombining both worlds — the medieval and the maritime — is what turns a day in Alcudia into something special. It is not just tourism: it is understanding how a place can have two souls and how both work perfectly together.\n\nHere is our itinerary, tested and refined after years living in this part of Mallorca. Follow it to the letter or adapt it to your own pace; the important thing is to enjoy it."

If you come by car, here is our guide on [where to park in Alcudia](https://coralboats.com/en/blog-details/parking-alcudia-donde-aparcar-gratis-puerto-playa) to find a spot without complications.",

        "subtitle": "Porta del Moll and the walk along the walls",
        "body": "Start at **Porta del Moll** (also known as Porta de Xara), the main gate to the walled enclosure. It is Alcudia’s most iconic image: a square tower of golden stone flanked by palm trees that has been welcoming visitors since the 14th century.\n\nFrom here, climb up to the **walls**. Alcudia is one of the few towns in Mallorca that has preserved its walls almost intact, and you can walk along a large part of them. The walk is not long (about 20 minutes at a relaxed pace), but the views are worth every step: on one side, the rooftops of the old town; on the other, the bay and the mountains of the Serra de Tramuntana in the distance.\n\n**Fun fact**: The walls you see today are actually the second set. The first were built by James II in the 13th century and were expanded in the 14th. Remains of the original walls are still visible in some sections."

        "body": "Coming down from the walls, head to **Sant Jaume Church**, right in the heart of the old town. Its stone façade with the large Gothic rose window dominates the square, and its fortress-like appearance is no coincidence: during times of pirate attacks, the church served as a refuge for locals.\n\nThe interior is worth a quick visit: austere yet elegant, with that cool silence only old stone churches have. If it is open (it usually is in the mornings), step inside for a few minutes.\n\nRight next to it is **Constitution Square**, with the Town Hall and its beautiful clock tower. This square is the epicenter of social life in the town: markets, festivals, meetings… Everything happens here. Grab a coffee at one of the terraces and simply observe. It is the best way to feel the pulse of Alcudia."

Alcudia’s old town is full of dead-end alleys, hidden courtyards, stone staircases leading nowhere, and corners where time seems to have stopped.\n\nStep away from the main street (Carrer Major) and wander into the side streets. You will find façades with green shutters faded by the sun, bougainvillea spilling over centuries-old stone walls, cats napping in doorways, and that particular silence of Mediterranean towns in the late morning.\n\nDo not look for anything specific. The magic lies in turning corners without knowing what is behind them. Alcudia is best enjoyed when you keep the map in your pocket.\n\n**Curiosity**: If you look closely at the ground in some streets, you will see stonemason marks on the stones. These were the signs medieval builders left to identify their work. Each master had their own personal mark."

Alcudia old town has several interesting restaurants, but we recommend looking for those on the side streets, not on the main square (where prices go up and quality sometimes goes down).\n\nLook for a place serving **Mallorcan cuisine**: tumbet (roasted vegetables with tomato), frit mallorquí (fried vegetables with meat or fish), pa amb oli (bread with tomato, olive oil, and cured meats), or arroz brut (a hearty rice stew with meat and mushrooms). These are filling but honest dishes, made with local produce.\n\nIf you prefer something lighter, several cafés in the old town offer salads, sandwiches, and mixed plates at good prices. The important thing is to sit on a shaded terrace and let the hottest part of the day pass.\n\nAnd if you want to discover Mediterranean flavors in a different way, our [boat tours](https://coralboats.com/en/boat-tours-alcudia) include **Mallorcan tapas and homemade sangria** prepared on board by our crew. Another way to eat well, but with sea views.

After 11:00 in summer, it gets crowded and moving around becomes difficult. Plus, the best products sell out quickly.\n\nThe market usually ends around 13:00–13:30, so it fits perfectly into the itinerary: walls, market, and lunch in the old town before heading to the port in the afternoon.\n\nIf it does not coincide with a market day, no problem.

Sneakers or sandals with good grip, no heels.\n- **Sun protection**: Even in spring and autumn, the Mallorcan sun is strong. Sunscreen, a hat, and sunglasses, especially for the port walk.\n- **Water**: Bring a bottle. In summer, the heat inside the walls can be intense.\n- **Cash**: Some small bars and shops in the old town do not accept cards. Carry some cash just in case.\n- **Opening hours**: Old town shops usually close from 13:30 to 17:00 in summer (siesta is sacred). Plan your visit to the town in the morning.\n- **Parking**: [Parking in Alcudia](https://coralboats.com/en/blog-details/parking-alcudia-donde-aparcar-gratis-puerto-playa) can be tricky in high season. We recommend parking in the free areas outside the walls and walking in.\n- **Traveling with kids**: Alcudia is very family-friendly. The old town is largely pedestrian, and the port has wide open areas. Take a look at our [boat plans for families](https://coralboats.com/en/blog-details/planes-barco-familias-ninos) if you want to combine the town with a maritime excursion.\n- **Transport**: If you do not have a car, you can read our guide on [how to get around Mallorca](https://coralboats.com/en/blog-details/como-moverse-por-mallorca-transporte-alquiler-coche) for bus and rental options."

Northern Mallorca — with its wide Alcudia Bay, calm and sheltered waters, and spectacular scenery — has become one of Europe’s favourite destinations for this experience.\n\nFrom the **Port of Alcudia** to **Port de Pollença**, via **Playa de Muro** and **Can Picafort**, the area offers plenty of options to **rent jet skis** and explore the coast from a unique perspective. Whether you’re a complete beginner or an experienced rider, there are options for every level.\n\nAt **Coral Boats** we focus on [boat tours in Alcudia](https://coralboats.com/en/boat-tours-alcudia), but as a local company with years of experience in the bay, we know the full range of **water activities** available in the area.

    "title": "What is a jet ski and why is it so popular in Mallorca?",
    "body": "A **jet ski** (also known as a **personal watercraft**, **PWC** or **watercraft**) is a personal vessel powered by a jet propulsion system that draws in water and expels it at high pressure to generate thrust. Unlike traditional boats, a jet ski is operated similarly to a motorbike, with the rider (and sometimes a passenger) seated astride.\n\n**Jet Ski** is actually Kawasaki’s brand name, although it has become the generic term for all personal watercraft. Other popular brands include **Sea-Doo** (BRP), **Yamaha WaveRunner**, and **Honda AquaTrax** — all commonly found at rental centres in northern Mallorca.\n\n**Why are they so popular in Alcudia Bay?**\n\nThe bay offers near-perfect jet ski conditions:\n\n- **Calm, sheltered waters**: The bay’s horseshoe shape helps protect it from prevailing winds, creating ideal conditions on most days during the season.\n- **Comfortable water temperature**: From June to October, the water typically ranges between 22°C and 27°C — perfect for water activities.\n- **Spectacular scenery**: From the sea you can enjoy cliffs, unspoilt beaches, the Serra de Tramuntana in the distance, and the silhouette of Cap de Formentor.\n- **Strong nautical infrastructure**: The Port of Alcudia, Port de Pollença and the main beaches have professional rental operators.\n- **Variety of routes**: From easy rides in shallow waters to longer trips exploring the north coast.\n\nIf you’d like to experience the bay from a different perspective, our [boat tours](https://coralboats.com/en/boat-tours-alcudia) take in many of the same landscapes at a more relaxed pace, with snorkelling stops, tapas on board, and the chance to enjoy sunset from the water."

      "subtitle": "Do I need a license to ride a jet ski?",
      "body": "**Yes and no**, depending on the jet ski’s power and how you rent it:\n\n- **Jet skis up to 55 hp**: You DO NOT need a boating license. Any adult can ride after receiving basic instructions from the rental operator.\n- **Jet skis over 55 hp**: You need at least the **Navigation License** (formerly known as “titulín”). Very powerful models may require **PNB (Basic Navigation Skipper)** or higher qualifications.\n\n**The good news**: Most rental companies in Alcudia, Playa de Muro and Can Picafort offer **jet skis up to 55 hp** specifically so visitors can enjoy the experience without needing a license.\n\n**Important**: Even if you don’t need a license, rental operators must provide a **basic safety briefing** before you go out. This includes:\n- How to start and stop the jet ski\n- Throttle and steering control\n- What to do if you fall into the water\n- Basic navigation rules\n- Allowed and restricted areas\n- Use of the life jacket and safety lanyard"

In this case, the adult does not need a license if the jet ski is low-powered.\n\n**What about younger children?**\n\nUnder-16s **cannot ride**, but they may go as **passengers** on a two-seater jet ski as long as:\n- The rider is an adult\n- The child wears an approved life jacket\n- The rental operator allows it (some set their own minimum ages, typically 6–8)\n\nEach company may have additional policies, so we always recommend checking before booking if you’re travelling with minors."

    "title": "Safety tips for riding a jet ski",
    "body": "Jet skiing is safe when done responsibly. However, like any motorised water sport, it comes with risks you should understand and minimise. Here are our **safety tips** based on years of experience in the bay:\n\n**Before you go out**:\n- **Listen carefully to the rental operator’s briefing**. Even if it sounds obvious, it can prevent accidents.\n- **Check your life jacket**: it should fit properly and be approved.\n- **Attach the safety lanyard** to your wrist or life jacket. If you fall, it disconnects and the engine stops automatically.\n- **Inspect the jet ski** visually before departure. If anything looks off, report it.\n- **Check sea and wind conditions**. If there’s a yellow or red flag, don’t go.\n\n**While riding**:\n- **Keep a safe distance** from boats, swimmers, kayaks and paddle boarders. Stay at least 50–100 metres from the shoreline.\n- **Adjust your speed to conditions**: slow down in busy areas or choppy water.\n- **Avoid sharp turns** near other sea users.\n- **Respect swimming zones**: buoys are there for a reason.\n- **If you cross paths with a large boat**, remember it has right of way and manoeuvres slowly.\n- **Watch for sudden wind and swell changes**.\n\n**If you fall off**:\n- Stay calm. Your life jacket will keep you afloat.\n- Swim back to the jet ski from the rear (never from the jet nozzle side).\n- Climb on using the rear platform.\n- If you can’t get back on, stay with the jet ski and wait for assistance.\n\n**Extra tips**:\n- **Water-resistant sunscreen**: choose a sport SPF50.\n- **Sunglasses with a strap**: wind is strong and it’s easy to lose them.\n- **Snug swimwear**: avoid loose clothing that can snag or flap.\n- A **waterproof pouch** for car keys or documents if needed.\n- **Avoid alcohol** before and during the activity — it’s dangerous and illegal.\n\nRemember: the sea changes quickly and deserves respect. If you’re unsure about weather or safe routes, ask local professionals. We at [Coral Boats](https://coralboats.com/en/about) are always happy to help when people ask."

  "section8": {
    "title": "Jet ski vs. other water activities: what should you choose?",
    "body": "Northern Mallorca offers a huge variety of **water activities** — jet skiing is just one option. Here’s a quick guide to help you decide whether it’s right for you or if another activity fits better:\n\n**Jet ski**: Adrenaline, speed, freedom. Perfect if you want excitement and wind-in-your-face thrills. It requires attention and some physical effort. It doesn’t include stops or add-on activities.\n\n**Parasailing**: Flying over the sea under a parachute is spectacular, but it’s passive — you don’t control anything. Great for aerial views and photos.\n\n**Banana boat / inflatables**: Fun group activity with lots of laughs, especially for kids and teens. No skill required — just hang on.\n\n**Paddle boarding (SUP)**: Slow pace, gentle exercise, connection with the sea. Great for exploring coves and calm waters. We include it on our [boat tours](https://coralboats.com/en/boat-tours-alcudia).\n\n**Kayaking**: Similar to paddle boarding but seated. Good for longer distances and going as a pair.\n\n**Snorkelling**: Explore the seabed, spot fish, discover posidonia seagrass. A relaxing activity we also include on our [tours](https://coralboats.com/en/alcudia-morning-boat-tour).\n\n**Boat trips**: If you want to enjoy the sea without effort — with tapas, drinks, soft music and swimming stops — our boat tours are the perfect choice. Ideal for couples, families and groups who prefer to relax.\n\n**Our recommendation**: If you’ve never tried jet skiing and it appeals to you, do it at least once — it’s a unique experience. And if you want something calmer afterwards, our [sunset tour](https://coralboats.com/en/alcudia-sunset-boat-tour) will be waiting with cold sangria and the best bay views."

    "title": "Jet ski FAQ in Alcudia and Mallorca",
    "body": "**Can I rent a jet ski without a license in Alcudia?**\nYes — as long as the jet ski is up to 55 hp, which is what most rental companies offer to tourists.\n\n**How many people can ride a jet ski?**\nMost rental jet skis are two-seaters: one rider and one passenger. Some larger models can take up to 3 people, but that’s less common.\n\n**Do I need to know how to swim to ride a jet ski?**\nOfficially it’s not mandatory, but it’s **highly recommended**. If you fall off, you’ll need to swim back to the jet ski. The life jacket helps, but swimming ability adds a lot of safety.\n\n**Can my 8-year-old ride as a passenger?**\nIt depends on the operator. Many allow child passengers from around 6–8 years old, always with a life jacket and accompanied by an adult rider. Check before booking.\n\n**What if the jet ski breaks down or I run out of fuel?**\nRental companies have protocols for these cases and will usually assist you with another boat. That’s why it’s important not to go beyond the permitted area.\n\n**Can I book in advance?**\nYes — and in peak season (July–August) it’s strongly recommended. Many operators offer online or phone bookings.\n\n**What’s the difference between a free rental and a guided safari?**\nWith a free rental, you choose your route within a restricted area. With a guided safari, an instructor leads the group, which allows you to go further and see places you might not find on your own.\n\n**Can you go jet skiing year-round in Mallorca?**\nThe main season runs from May to October. Outside these months, many companies close or operate only on request and in favourable weather conditions.\n\n**Where can I get advice on the best jet ski operators?**\nOur crew at [Coral Boats](https://coralboats.com/en/about), operating from the Port of Alcudia for years, knows the area and local operators well. If you join one of our tours, feel free to ask — we’ll gladly recommend where to rent, which routes to do, and which operator best fits what you’re looking for.\n\n---\n\nWe hope this guide helps you plan your **jet ski experience in Alcudia**. Northern Mallorca has a lot to offer on the water — whether you’re racing across the sea on a jet ski or cruising calmly on our traditional boats.\n\nSee you on the sea? 🌊"
